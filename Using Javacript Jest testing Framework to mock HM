 Using Javacript Jest testing Framework to mock HMSLocation.
 There is a problem of how to mock HMSLocation with the Jest framework
 as describe here:
"
	 I'm trying to mock the @hmscore/react-native-hms-location with jest. The function that one of my providers uses is HMSLocation.FusedLocation.Native.hasPermission(), but in one of my test I always get the following:

	TypeError: Cannot read property 'Native' of undefined at call (C:\laragon\www\qmy-project\providers\LocationProvider.js:65:57)
	I've tried to mock all the Library like this:

	jest.mock('@hmscore/react-native-hms-location');
	Even like this another way:

	jest.mock('@hmscore/react-native-hms-location', () => {
	    const original = jest.requireActual('@hmscore/react-native-hms-location');    
	    return original;
	});
	Always is the same. Any help please?
"
is there is a sample of how to use the Jest framework with HMSLocation?
